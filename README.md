    Server Registration: Servers can register with a unique name, public key, and IP address.

    Heartbeat Mechanism: Servers send periodic heartbeats to indicate they are active.

    Client Assignment: Clients can select servers and receive their public key and IP address.

    Reputation System: Servers can gain or lose reputation based on their performance.

    Decentralized: Built on the Internet Computer for transparency and security.
